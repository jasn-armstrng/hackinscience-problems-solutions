# Program converts decimals to Roman numerals

# Version 1.0 refactored and a here the function `convert(...)` is a more concise
# implementation of the functions previously implemented to handle the conversion
# of units, tens, hundredths and thousands.
# The stack has also been removed, now the output string is buiilt dynamically as
# the number is processed

# I pictured convert() as a series of processing pipelines that would handle a
# number based on its positional value. The below but rotated 90ยบ

#          ------------------------
# 1s    ->                          -> I, V, IX, ...
#          ------------------------
# 10s   ->                          -> X, L, LXX, ...
#          ------------------------
# 100s  ->                          -> C, D, DCCC, ...
#          ------------------------

# Thousands are processed much faster
#          -------
# 1000s ->         -> M, MM, ...
#          -------

# To do:
# 1. This program assumes that a +ve integer is entered for conversion
# 2.

def to_roman_numeral(number: int) -> str:
    # Rules:
    #   1. If the units part of the number is < 4 it is represented by the equivalent number of 'I's
    #   2. If the units part of the number is 1 less than 5 or 10 it is represented by 'I' followed by the the representations for 5 'V' or 10 'X'
    #   3. If the units part of the number is > 5 and < 9 it is represented by 5 'V' and the equivalent number of 'I's to make up that number
    #   4. If the tenths part of the number is < 40 it is represented by the equivalent number of 'X's
    #   5. If the tenths part of the number is 10 less 50 or 100 it is represented by 'X' followed by the the representations for 50 'L' or 100 'C'
    #   6. If the tenths part of the number is > 50 and < 90 it is represented by 50 'L' and the equivalent number of 'X's to make up that number
    #   7. If the hundredths part of the number is < 400 it is represented by the equivalent number of 'C's
    #   8. If the hundredths part of the number is 100 less 500 or 1000 it is represented by 'C' followed by the the representations for 500 'D' or 100 'M'
    #   9. If the hundredths part of the number is > 500 and < 900 it is represented by 500 'D' and the equivalent number of 'C's to make up that number
    #   10. The thousandths part of the number is represented by the equivalent number of 'M's

    # Actions:
    #   1. Divide the number into units, tenths, hundredths, thousands
    #   2. Convert the number according to its place value
    #   3. Combine the resulting roman numeric strings from action 2
